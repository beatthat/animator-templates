Unity editor tools for defining AnimatorController templates which can be easily copied and assigned via editor scripts. This is useful if you want to have an editor option to 'Create a MyComponent' where new instances of MyComponent depend on having an animator whose controller has a particular set up, e.g must has this set of params and layer[s] that handle those params in a default way. An important point is these tools make it easy for such a component to get its own copy of the (template) AnimatorController, so you can then customize.
